  </h1>
  <p id="p1"> My favourite hobby is video games and that is because it is fun to play with my friends in an imaginary world and it is just fun in general. I really like video games. It helps build my teammate skills, my leadership skills and it also helps me socialise and make new friends. One more thing it can benefit me is that it can help me socialise and make new friends in a pandemic such as this one. Also it benefits me in a way so that I can escape from real life and emerse myself in an imaginary interactive world where my creativity is never limited and I have complete freedom.
